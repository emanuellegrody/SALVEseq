# SALVEseq
# enriched viral isoformome sequencing

### Project codes:
- EGS_001 – Designing SIVmac293 primers to amplify gag and env
- EGS_002 – Test EGS001 primers on new samples: in vivo viremia (W2), in vitro infection (invitro), and no infection control (W0)
- EGS_003 – New primers designed for two new library preparation strategies that include fragmentation of long sequences
